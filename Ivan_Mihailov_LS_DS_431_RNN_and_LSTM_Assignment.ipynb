no shape so trueno truth of such account  and for myself mine own worth do define  as i all other in all worths surmount  but when my glass shows me myself indeed beated and chopp d with tanned

and died as flowers do now  before these bastard signs of fair were born  or durst inhabit on a living brow  before the golden tresses of the dead  the right of sepulchreswere shorn away  to live a second life on second head  ere beauty s dead fleece made another gay  in him those holy antique hours are seen  without all ornamentitself and true  making no summer of another s green  robbing no old to dress his beauty new  and him as for a map doth nature store  to show false art what beauty was of yore  those parts of thee that the world s eye doth view want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend  all tongues--the voice of souls--give thee that due  uttering bare trutheven so as foes commend  thy outward thus with outward praise is crown d  but those same tonguesthat give thee so thine own  in other accents do this praise confound by seeing farther than the eye hath shown  they look into the beauty of thy mind  and that in guess they measure by thy deeds  then--churls--their thoughtsalthough their eyes were kind  to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds  but why thy odour matcheth not thy show  the soil is thisthat thou dost common grow  that thou art blam d shall not be thy defect  for slander s mark was ever yet the fair  the ornament of beauty is suspect  a crow that flies in heaven s sweetest air  so thou be goodslander doth but approve thy worth the greater being woo d of time  for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love  and thou present st a pure unstained prime  thou hast passed by the ambush of young days either not

owe  no longer mourn for me when i am dead than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell  nayif you read this lineremember not the hand that writ itfor i love you so  that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot  if thinking on me then should make you woe  oif --i say you look upon this verse  when i perhaps compounded am with clay  do not so much as my poor name rehearse  but let your love even with my life decay  lest the wise world should look into your moan  and mock you with me after i am gone  olest the world should task you to recite what merit lived in methat you should love after my death --dear loveforget me quite  for you in me can nothing worthy prove  unless you would devise some virtuous lie  to do more for me than mine own desert  and hang more praise upon deceased i than niggard truth would willingly impart  olest your true love may seem false in this that you for love speak well of me untrue  my name be buried where my body is  and live no more to shame nor me nor you  for i am shamed by that which i bring forth  and so should youto love things nothing worth  that time of year thou mayst in me behold when yellow leavesor noneor fewdo hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold  bare ruin d choirswhere late the sweet birds sang  in me thou see st the twilight of such day as after sunset fadeth in the west  which by and by black night doth take away  death s second selfthat seals up all in rest  in me thou see st the glowing of such fire  that on the ashes of his youth doth lie  as the death-bedwhereon it must expire  consum d with that which it was nourish d by  this thou perceiv stwhich makes thy love more strong  to love that wellwhich thou must leave ere

dost review the very part was consecrate to thee  the earth can have but earthwhich is his due  my spirit is thinethe better part of me  so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life  the prey of wormsmy body being dead  the coward conquest of a wretch s knife  too base of thee to be remembered  the worth of that is that which it contains  and that is thisand this with thee remains  so are you to my thoughts as food to life  or as sweet-season d showers are to the ground  and for the peace of you i hold such strife astwixt a miser and his wealth is found  now proud as an enjoyerand anon doubting the filching age will steal his treasure  now counting best to be with you alone  then better d that the world may see my pleasure  sometime all full with feasting on your sight  and by and by clean starved for a look  possessing or pursuing no delight  save what is hador must from you be took  thus do i pine and surfeit day by day  or gluttoning on allor all away  why is my verse so barren of new pride  so far from variation or quick change  why with the time do i not glance aside to new-found methodsand to compounds strange  why write i still all oneever the same  and keep invention in a noted weed  that every word doth almost tell my name  showing their birthand where they did proceed  oknow sweet love i always write of you  and you and love are still my argument  so all my best is dressing old words new  spending again what is already spent  for as the sun is daily new and old  so is my love still telling what is told  thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear  thy dial how thy precious minutes waste  these vacant leaves thy mind s imprint will bear  and of this bookthis learning mayst thou taste  the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show of mouthed graves will give thee memory  thou by thy dial s shady stealth mayst know time s thievish progress to eternity  lookwhat thy memory cannot contain  commit to these waste blanksand thou shalt find those children nurseddeliver d from thy brain  to take a new acquaintance of thy mind  these officesso oft as thou wilt look  shall profit thee and much enrich thy book  so oft have i invoked thee for my muse  and found such fair assistance in my verse as every alien pen hath got my use and under thee their poesy disperse  thine eyesthat taught the dumb on high to sing and heavy ignorance aloft to fly  have added feathers to the learned s wing and given grace a double majesty  yet be most proud of that which i compile  whose influence is thineand born of thee  in othersworks thou dost but mend the style  and arts with thy sweet graces graced be  but thou art all my artand dost advance as high as learningmy rude ignorance  whilst i alone did call upon thy aid  my verse alone had all thy gentle grace  but now my gracious numbers are decay d  and my sick muse doth give an other place  i grantsweet lovethy lovely argument deserves the travail of a worthier pen  yet what of thee thy poet doth invent he robs thee ofand pays it thee again  he lends thee virtueand he stole that word from thy behaviourbeauty doth he give  and found it in thy cheekhe can afford no praise to theebut what in thee doth live  then thank him not for that which he doth say  since what he owes theethou thyself dost pay  ohow i faint when i of you do write  knowing a better spirit doth use your name  and in the praise thereof spends all his might  to make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame  but since your worth--wide as the ocean is -- the humble as the proudest sail doth bear  my saucy barkinferior far to his  on your broad main doth wilfully appear  your shallowest help will hold me up afloat  whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride  orbeing wrack di am a worthless boat  he of tall buildingand of goodly pride  then if he thrive and i be cast away  the worst was this --my love was my decay  or i shall live your epitaph to make  or you survive when i in earth am rotten  from hence your memory death cannot take  although in me each part will be forgotten  your name from hence immortal life shall have  though ionce goneto all the world must die  the earth can yield me but a common grave  when you entombed in men s eyes shall lie  your monument shall be my gentle verse  which eyes not yet created shall o er-read  and tongues to beyour being shall rehearse  when all the breathers of

quill doth come too short  speaking of worthwhat worth in you doth grow  this silence for my sin you did impute  which shall be most my glory being dumb  for i impair not beauty being mute  when
